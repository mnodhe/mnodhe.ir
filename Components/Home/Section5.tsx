              every branch we had department and position for all of them and in any position, we had another position
              and another position in that position. So, I created a factorial like component for position and created
              the redux state management base on their needs and for the sake of the User Experience, I developed
              an heretically like UI base on the response of the companys organizational chart so the user can easily

              developed a stored procedure that could accept Json and then got all sanss in an array of jsons and sent
              them to the site API with one request. There were so many challenges in that job but I think that was
              worth explaining because all cinemas local server was sql 2008 and some programing function to solve
              this solution does not work in this version and it required at least version 2016.'
